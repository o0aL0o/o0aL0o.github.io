            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>"Exercising is very important. But nowadays, people have no time to do exercise. Moreover, people 
                need to pay more attention to the importance of a few minutes of exercise. We want to make a 
                board game that mainly focuses on exercising. We want the players to spend 10 to 20 minutes doing 
                exercises together. Our game is not only an exercise game. However, we also have some competitive 
                and reaction games. Our game-winning condition is that the player who gets the highest points wins. 
                It may be unfair to the less strong player. Nevertheless, our game goals are also focused on player 
                participation. So that all the players can play and enjoy the game among all ages. After playing our 
                game, we want all the players to learn to exercise and feel satisfaction.

            <h3>Game description</h3>
            <p>
                The game can be played in a group of 3 to 4 people. The game has a total of five rounds. In each 
                round, the player must draw a card from shuffled cards after each player has drawn one card. One 
                round is over. <br><br>
                Our game has four different cards.  <br><br>
                Monster cards: Each monster card has a different exercise set, and the 
                amount of exercise is at the bottom of the card. The player who draws this 
                card needs to follow the exercise. After the player finishes it, they will earn 
                one point. <br><br>
                Reaction cards: Each reaction card has a different pose. When one player 
                draws a reaction card, the player must follow the card's pose as fast as 
                possible. The fastest player will earn one point. 
                Competition cards: Each competition card has a different set of exercises 
                and time. This card also has two types. One is one on one. The second is 
                team competition. The rule is simple. In the competition, there will be a 
                fixed timer. Players need to do the most exercise. And the highest amount 
                wins. <br><br>
                Function cards: Each player will get three different cards at the start of the 
                game. Function cards are like chance cards for players.  
                "Strength Point"  
                Players will earn one extra point after finishing the Monster or Competition 
                cards. 
                "Designate a player for 1v1."  
                Players can choose a player to compete in the competition cards. 
                "Reduce the number of exercises by half." 
                Players can reduce the number of exercises by half on the monster card. 
                The winning goal is the player with the highest points win. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Game flow</h3>
            <p>
                Firstly, the player needs to separate the function cards from other cards. Then, shuffling other cards 
                such as monster cards, reaction cards, competition cards. Then, player need to use rock paper 
                scissors to decide who are the first player. Then, the first player decided to who is the next player. 
                Then, the player draws the shuffled card.<br><br>
                When all players draw the cards once, the first-round end and the next round start until the final 
                round. Totally has 5 rounds. In the process, the player could use the function cards to help them 
                winning the game easily.
